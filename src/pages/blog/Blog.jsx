Uncontrolled components are form inputs in React that maintain their own internal state and do not receive any updates from the parent component. Controlled components, on the other hand, are form inputs that receive their value from the parent component and notify the parent component of any changes. In short, controlled components are more closely managed by the parent component, while uncontrolled components manage their own state.</p>
